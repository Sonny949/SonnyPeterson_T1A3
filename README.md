# Music Scales App

This is a simple terminal driven application written in Ruby to display common scales related to any given musical note. It also allows a user to save the scale to an outside file or save notes from the scale in no specific order. It was designed for beginner musicians to not only easily find common scales related to any given note, but to be able to save notes from the scales in an order that they find pleasing to the ear as they play through the scales on their instrument. These notes may later be turned into a song by saving to an external text file.

## Requirements

Please adjust your terminal so the window size is at least 120 x 30 for optimum playback.
