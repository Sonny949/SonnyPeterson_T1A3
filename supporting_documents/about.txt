About Terminal Music
This app was designed for beginner musicians (such as myself) to easily access popular scales related to any given note.
Ever forgotten a fifth? Don't want to get the note chart out and start 'hopping'? Ever forgotten the Blues interval progression?
Well, this app is for you.
Ever sit looking at a scale and playing through the notes and think to yourself "This sound is fire, I have to remember this!"
Then the next day you're trying to play it and can't remember a danged thing.
I've got you covered. With the save and edit features you can choose to save your progressions for later use in song-writing or just playing that sound you enjoy.
This software is open source and free to download and use.

This app is available to anyone that wants to use it.
There is no login. All files are available to all users. I like it this way.
That means I can look at combinations made by others and play them. So can you.
There is a lot of trust involved in this. Please don't wreck files made by others. Make your own instead!
But also, it's a good idea to make copies of your files if you like them. Check the help docs for more info on this.

If there are any other scales you wish to see, let me know. But I will be adding scales as I encounter them in the wild anyway.
Enjoy!
